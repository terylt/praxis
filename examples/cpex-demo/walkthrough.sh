# Narrated end-to-end walkthrough of every demo feature. Fires the
# 7 scenario scripts in sequence with explanatory text between each,
# so a live audience can see:
#
#   * the actual HTTP request the gateway received
#   * what the gateway responded with (success result vs MCP JSON-RPC
#     error envelope vs HTTP 401)
#   * which violation code (if any) the gateway emitted
#
# Pairs well with a second terminal running:
#
#     docker compose logs -f hr-mcp
#
# so the audience can see (or NOT see) the request reaching the
# backend — and the audit-log JSON the gateway emits on its stderr.
#
# Usage:
#
#     ./walkthrough.sh            # narrated, pause for input between scenarios
#     ./walkthrough.sh --fast     # no pauses — for smoke-testing
#
# Assumes the stack is already up: `docker compose up -d` and the
# gateway is running on :8090. Run `./verify-token-exchange.sh` first
# if you want to double-check Keycloak.

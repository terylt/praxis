# Proposals

Proposals for new capabilities and refinements in Praxis.

Small changes (bug fixes, minor enhancements, documentation
updates) do not require proposals. Proposals are for
features that span multiple PRs, introduce new
architectural patterns, affect the project's public
interface, or are complex enough they warrant more process.

## Lifecycle

### 1. Discussion

Open a [GitHub Discussion] describing the change at a
high level. Focus on *what* and *why*, not implementation
details.

Build consensus with community members.

> **Note**: Some implementation details at this stage can
> be OK, depending on the situation. Just keep in mind the
> point of the discussion phase is to get consensus that
> what you're bringing up is a real concern that needs to
> be addressed, regardless of "How?" it is addressed.

[GitHub Discussion]: https://github.com/praxis-proxy/praxis/discussions

### 2. Sign-off

A maintainer reviews the discussion and marks it as
approved. This confirms the project is open to the
proposed direction.

> **Note**: It's fair to directly ping maintainers asking
> for review and approval consideration when things get stuck.

### 3. Issue

Once the discussion is approved by a maintainer and resolved,
create an `EPIC` issue from the discussion. Include first a link
to the originating discussion, followed by a high-level summary.
This is where all implementation work will be organized (as
sub-tasks).

> **Note**: Maintainers will assign epic and sub-task owners.

### 4. Proposal PR

Create a proposal file in `docs/proposals/` and submit it
as a PR. File naming convention:

```console
<issue_number>_<high-level-slug>.md
```

The first PR must contain only the **What?** and **Why?**
sections. The **How?** section is almost always contentious
and must be added in a follow-up PR after the goals and
motivation are accepted. See the [template] for the full
structure.

CI will close PRs that:

- Are missing a `discussion` or `issue` link
- Have no `authors` listed
- Include the `How?` section in a new proposal

### 5. Iteration

Iterate on the proposal in subsequent PRs. Add the
**How?** section with requirements and design details.
Refine until a maintainer marks the proposal as accepted.

### 6. Experimental

Once accepted, someone (perhaps the authors of the
proposal) will be tasked with implementing the feature
and ship it as experimental. Experimental features are
functional but may change based on user feedback, and
nothing about them is guaranteed.

> **Note**: In particular, updates to experimental features
> may make breaking, backwards-incompatible changes. An
> experimental feature may be removed at any time.thing about them is guaranteed.

### 7. Release

After a soak period determined by maintainers a maintainer
may promote the feature from experimental to released. The
proposal status is updated to `released`.

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
| -------- | --------- |
| `proposed` | Under discussion, not yet accepted |
| `accepted` | Approved for implementation |
| `experimental` | Implemented, shipping as experimental |
| `released` | Stable, fully shipped |
| `withdrawn` | Not proceeding (includes explanation) |

> **Note**: A proposal with status `withdrawn` must include a clear,
> detailed explanation of why it was withdrawn.

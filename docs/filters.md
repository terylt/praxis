# Filters

## Listeners

    Pipeline --> Pool["Upstream Pool"]
    Pool --> Backend

    Config["Config (YAML)"] -. startup .-> Chains
    Chains["filter_chains:"] -. per listener .-> Resolve
```

Each listener has a `name` and a list of `filter_chains`.
At startup, the referenced chains are resolved and
concatenated into a single pipeline per listener. Different
listeners can compose different subsets of chains.

## Filter Model

Filters are the core processing units in Praxis. Each
filter is a small (preferably), composable function that
inspects or transforms traffic at a single point in the
request/response lifecycle.

Filters are chained into pipelines; the pipeline executor
calls each filter in order on requests and in reverse on responses.

### What Filters Receive

**HTTP filters** receive an `HttpFilterContext` containing:

- `client_addr`: downstream IP (from the TCP connection)
- `downstream_tls`: whether the client connection uses TLS
- `health_registry`: endpoint health state
- `request`: method, URI, and headers
- `response_header`: response status and headers (**only in response phase**)
- `cluster` / `upstream`: current routing selections (may be set by earlier filters)
- `rewritten_path`: path set by a preceding rewrite filter (**Praxis will include this in routing decisions**)
- Request and response body chunks (only if the filter declares `BodyAccess::ReadOnly` or `BodyAccess::ReadWrite`)

**TCP filters** receive a `TcpFilterContext` with
connection metadata: `remote_addr`, `local_addr`, `sni`
(SNI hostname from TLS ClientHello), `upstream_addr`
(mutable via `Cow`), timing, and byte counters.

### What Filters Can Do

Every filter hook returns a `FilterAction`:

- **`Continue`**: pass to the next filter in the pipeline.
- **`Reject`**: short-circuit with an HTTP response (status code, optional headers and body).
  Used by `static_response`, `redirect`, `rate_limit`, `guardrails`, `cors` preflight, and similar filters.
- **`Release`**: forward accumulated body data to upstream when using `StreamBuffer` mode.
  Behaves as `Continue` when body data is not relevant.

Filters also mutate `HttpFilterContext` fields to
influence downstream processing:

- `ctx.cluster`: select which upstream cluster to route to.
- `ctx.upstream`: select a specific endpoint.
- `ctx.rewritten_path`: rewrite the upstream request path.
- `ctx.extra_request_headers`: inject headers into the upstream request.
- `ctx.response_header`: mutate response headers directly in `on_response`.
- `ctx.response_headers_modified`: flag that response headers were changed

### Lifecycle Hooks

| Hook | Direction | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `on_request` | Forward (pipeline order) | Request |
| `on_response` | Reverse (pipeline order) | Response |
| `on_request_body` | Forward | Request body chunks |
| `on_response_body` | Reverse | Response body chunks |

Request `conditions` gate both the request and body
hooks. Response `response_conditions` gate only the
response hooks. A filter skipped on request is also
skipped on response.

### Common Patterns

See [`examples/configs/`] for working examples of every
pattern. A few highlights:

- **Host-based routing**: [hosts.yaml]
- **Path-based routing with rewriting**: [path-based-routing.yaml]
- **Security chain** (guardrails + IP ACL): [guardrails.yaml], [ip-acl.yaml]
- **Rate limiting with headers**: [rate-limiting.yaml]
- **Composed filter chains**: [composed-chains.yaml]
- **Conditional filters**: [conditional-filters.yaml]
- **Production gateway**: [production-gateway.yaml]

[`examples/configs/`]: ../examples/configs/
[hosts.yaml]: ../examples/configs/traffic-management/hosts.yaml
[path-based-routing.yaml]: ../examples/configs/traffic-management/path-based-routing.yaml
[guardrails.yaml]: ../examples/configs/security/guardrails.yaml
[ip-acl.yaml]: ../examples/configs/security/ip-acl.yaml

[composed-chains.yaml]: ../examples/configs/pipeline/composed-chains.yaml
[conditional-filters.yaml]: ../examples/configs/pipeline/conditional-filters.yaml
[production-gateway.yaml]: ../examples/configs/operations/production-gateway.yaml

## Filter Chains

Filter chains are named, reusable groups of filters defined
at the top level of the config. A listener references one or
more chains by name; the filters are concatenated in order
to form that listener's pipeline.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Listener: public"
        direction LR
        S["security chain"] --> O["observability chain"]
        O --> R["routing chain"]
    end

    subgraph "Listener: internal"
        direction LR
        O1["observability chain"] --> R2["routing chain"]
    end
```

This enables reuse without duplication. A "security" chain
can be shared across public listeners while internal
listeners skip it entirely.

### Protocol-Specific Filters

Every filter belongs to exactly one protocol level. HTTP
filters implement the `HttpFilter` trait (`on_request`,
`on_response`, body hooks). TCP filters implement the
`TcpFilter` trait (`on_connect`, `on_disconnect`). There
is no generic filter that operates at both levels. The
`AnyFilter` enum tags each filter with its protocol for
storage in a unified pipeline.

Built-in filters are organized by protocol, then by
category:

```text
builtins/
  http/                       HTTP protocol filters
    ai/                       AI workloads (inference)
    observability/            Access logs, request IDs
    payload_processing/       Compression, body field extraction
    security/                 CORS, CSRF, forwarded headers, guardrails, IP ACL
    traffic_management/       Router, load balancer, timeout, rate limit, redirect, static response
    transformation/           Header, path rewrite, URL rewrite
  tcp/                        TCP protocol filters
    observability/            Connection logging
    traffic_management/       SNI-based routing
```

At runtime, pipeline execution dispatches to the correct
filter type. HTTP execution (`execute_http_request`,
`execute_http_response`, body hooks) calls only HTTP
filters, skipping TCP entries. TCP execution
(`execute_tcp_connect`, `execute_tcp_disconnect`) calls
only TCP filters, skipping HTTP entries.

**Protocol stack model.** Higher-level protocols include
lower levels. HTTP's stack includes TCP, so an HTTP
listener accepts both HTTP and TCP filters in its
pipeline. A TCP listener accepts only TCP filters.
Validation enforces this via `ProtocolKind::supports()`.

| Listener Protocol | HTTP Filters | TCP Filters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `http` (default) | Yes | Yes |
| `tcp` | No | Yes |

    AnyFilter --> TcpFilter

    HttpListener["HTTP Listener"] -->|supports| HttpFilter
    HttpListener -->|supports| TcpFilter

```

## What Stays Outside Filters

- TCP/TLS, HTTP framing, connection pooling: adapters
- Config loading and validation: `praxis-core`
- Pipeline executor and `HttpFilterContext`: `praxis-filter`

## HttpFilter Trait

Every HTTP behavior in Praxis is an `HttpFilter`:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait HttpFilter: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    async fn on_request(
        &self, ctx: &mut HttpFilterContext<'_>,
    ) -> Result<FilterAction, FilterError>;
    async fn on_response(
        &self, ctx: &mut HttpFilterContext<'_>,
    ) -> Result<FilterAction, FilterError> {
        Ok(FilterAction::Continue)
    }
    // Body hooks and access/mode methods omitted for
    // brevity; see "Body Access" section below.
}
```

The trait also defines body access, body mode, and body
hook methods. See [Body Access](#body-access-http-only)
below for the full API.

`on_request` runs in order, `on_response` in reverse.

## TcpFilter Trait

TCP-level filters implement `TcpFilter`:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait TcpFilter: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    async fn on_connect(
        &self, ctx: &mut TcpFilterContext<'_>,
    ) -> Result<FilterAction, FilterError> {
        Ok(FilterAction::Continue)
    }
    async fn on_disconnect(
        &self, ctx: &mut TcpFilterContext<'_>,
    ) -> Result<(), FilterError> {
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

`on_connect` fires when a TCP connection is accepted.
`on_disconnect` fires when the connection closes. Both
hooks have default implementations that pass through.

## FilterAction

- `Continue` : pass to next filter
- `Reject(rejection)` : stop pipeline, respond now
- `Release` : forward accumulated StreamBuffer data to
  upstream; behaves as `Continue` in non-StreamBuffer
  contexts
- `BodyDone` : signal that this filter has finished body
  processing; subsequent body chunks skip this filter
  while other filters continue normally

```rust
FilterAction::Reject(Rejection::status(429)
    .with_header("Retry-After", "60")
    .with_body(b"rate limit exceeded" as &[u8]))
```

## HttpFilterContext

Shared state flowing through HTTP filters for a request:

```rust
pub struct HttpFilterContext<'a> {
    pub client_addr: Option<IpAddr>,
    pub cluster: Option<Arc<str>>,
    pub extra_request_headers: Vec<(Cow<'static, str>, String)>,
    pub health_registry: Option<&'a HealthRegistry>,
    pub request: &'a Request,
    pub request_start: Instant,
    pub response_header: Option<&'a mut Response>,
    pub request_body_bytes: u64,
    pub response_body_bytes: u64,
    pub response_headers_modified: bool,
    pub rewritten_path: Option<String>,
    pub upstream: Option<Upstream>,
}
```

## TcpFilterContext

Per-connection state for TCP filters:

```rust
pub struct TcpFilterContext<'a> {
    pub remote_addr: &'a str,
    pub local_addr: &'a str,
    pub sni: Option<&'a str>,
    pub upstream_addr: Cow<'a, str>,
    pub connect_time: Instant,
    pub bytes_in: u64,
    pub bytes_out: u64,
}
```

The `sni` field is populated by the TCP proxy when it peeks
at the first bytes of a TLS connection and extracts the SNI
hostname from the ClientHello. Filters like `sni_router` use
this to select an upstream. The `upstream_addr` field is a
`Cow` so filters can replace it with an owned value without
requiring the listener config to provide a static upstream.

## AnyFilter

The `AnyFilter` enum wraps both filter variants for storage
in a unified registry and pipeline:

```rust
pub enum AnyFilter {
    Http(Box<dyn HttpFilter>),
    Tcp(Box<dyn TcpFilter>),
}
```

Each variant reports its `protocol_level()` as
`ProtocolKind::Http` or `ProtocolKind::Tcp`.

## Body Access (HTTP only)

Filters see headers only by default. Opt in:

```rust
fn request_body_access(&self) -> BodyAccess {
    BodyAccess::ReadOnly // or ReadWrite
}
```

| Access           | Hooks? | Modify? |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `None` (default) | No     | No      |
| `ReadOnly`       | Yes    | No      |
| `ReadWrite`      | Yes    | Yes     |

### Body Mode

| Mode                          | Behavior        | Use case                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `Stream` (default)            | Per chunk       | Logging, transforms       |
| `StreamBuffer { max_bytes }`  | Deferred stream | Inspection before forward |

If any filter requests `StreamBuffer`, the pipeline
defers upstream forwarding until release.

### StreamBuffer Mode

`StreamBuffer` combines streaming inspection with deferred
forwarding. Filters see each chunk as it arrives (like
`Stream`) but the protocol layer accumulates them and does
not forward to upstream until a filter returns
`FilterAction::Release` or end-of-stream is reached.

```rust
fn request_body_mode(&self) -> BodyMode {
    // No limit (default):
    BodyMode::StreamBuffer { max_bytes: None }

    // With a limit (413 on overflow):
    // BodyMode::StreamBuffer { max_bytes: Some(1_048_576) }
}
```

A filter signals release by returning
`FilterAction::Release` from `on_request_body` or
`on_response_body`. After release, remaining chunks flow
through in stream mode.

When `max_bytes` is `None` (default), StreamBuffer
accumulates without limit. When `Some(n)`, requests
exceeding `n` bytes receive 413.

This mode is useful for:

- **AI inference proxies**: inspect prompt content for
  routing, token counting, or content policy before
  forwarding
- **Security gateways**: scan payloads for malware
  signatures, PII, or injection attacks with early
  rejection
- **Body-based routing**: peek at request body content
  (e.g. JSON model field) to select a cluster, then
  release and forward

### Body Hooks

```rust
// Async
async fn on_request_body(
    &self, ctx: &mut HttpFilterContext<'_>,
    body: &mut Option<Bytes>,
    end_of_stream: bool,
) -> Result<FilterAction, FilterError>;

// Sync (upstream constraint)
fn on_response_body(
    &self, ctx: &mut HttpFilterContext<'_>,
    body: &mut Option<Bytes>,
    end_of_stream: bool,
) -> Result<FilterAction, FilterError>;
```

Override `needs_request_context() -> true` to access request
headers in body hooks.

## Conditional Execution

Add `conditions` to any filter chain entry. Fields within a
condition are ANDed; all conditions must pass.

| Field         | Matches when                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `path`        | URI exactly equals value     |
| `path_prefix` | URI starts with value        |
| `methods`     | Method in list               |
| `headers`     | All listed headers match     |

```yaml
filter_chains:
  - name: main
    filters:
      - filter: headers
        conditions:
          - when:
              path_prefix: "/api"
          - unless:
              headers:
                x-internal: "true"
        request_add:
          - name: "X-Api-Version"
            value: "v2"
```

Use `path` for exact matching (e.g., health checks on `/`):

```yaml
- filter: static_response
  conditions:
    - when:
        path: "/"
  status: 200
  body: "ok"
```

Skipped on request = skipped on response.

### Response Conditions

Use `response_conditions` to gate `on_response` execution.
Response predicates: `status` (list of status codes),
`headers`.

```yaml
- filter: headers
  response_conditions:
    - when:
        status: [200, 201]
  response_set:
    - name: "Cache-Control"
      value: "public, max-age=60"
```

A filter can have both `conditions` (request phase) and
`response_conditions` (response phase).

## Built-in Filters

| `model_to_header` | AI / Inference | HTTP | Extract JSON "model" field and promote to X-Model header. Requires `ai-inference` feature. |

For detailed configuration of each built-in filter, see
[configuration.md](configuration.md).

### Security Filter Restrictions

Security-critical filters (`ip_acl`, `forwarded_headers`)
reject `failure_mode: open` by default. Open failure mode
on these filters means runtime errors would bypass security
enforcement. To override this check, set
`insecure_options.allow_open_security_filters: true`, which
demotes the error to a warning.

### Rewrite and Routing Interaction

Both `path_rewrite` and `url_rewrite` set
`ctx.rewritten_path`. The router checks `rewritten_path`
before the original URI, enabling "rewrite then route"
pipelines. If both rewrite filters appear in the same
pipeline, only the last one takes effect. Validation
rejects this by default; set `allow_rewrite_override: true`
on the later filter to permit it.

## Custom Filters

### HTTP Filter Example

Create a crate for your filter(s):

```toml
[dependencies]
praxis-filter = { git = "https://github.com/praxis-proxy/praxis" }
async-trait = "0.1.89"
serde = { version = "1.0.228", features = ["derive"] }
serde_yaml = "0.9.34"
```

```rust
// my_filters/src/lib.rs
use async_trait::async_trait;
use praxis_filter::{
    HttpFilter, FilterAction, HttpFilterContext,
    FilterError, Rejection,
};
use serde::Deserialize;

pub struct ApiKeyFilter { valid_keys: Vec<String> }

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Config { keys: Vec<String> }

impl ApiKeyFilter {
    pub fn from_config(
        config: &serde_yaml::Value,
    ) -> Result<Box<dyn HttpFilter>, FilterError> {
        let cfg: Config =
            serde_yaml::from_value(config.clone())?;
        Ok(Box::new(Self { valid_keys: cfg.keys }))
    }
}

#[async_trait]
impl HttpFilter for ApiKeyFilter {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str { "api_key" }

    async fn on_request(
        &self, ctx: &mut HttpFilterContext<'_>,
    ) -> Result<FilterAction, FilterError> {
        let key = ctx.request.headers
            .get("x-api-key")
            .and_then(|v| v.to_str().ok());
        match key {
            Some(k)
                if self.valid_keys.iter().any(|v| v == k)
            => {
                Ok(FilterAction::Continue)
            }
            _ => Ok(FilterAction::Reject(
                Rejection::status(401),
            )),
        }
    }
}
```

Factory signature:
`fn(&serde_yaml::Value) -> Result<Box<dyn HttpFilter>, FilterError>`.
Filters are created once at startup, must be `Send + Sync`.

### TCP Filter Example

```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;
use praxis_filter::{
    TcpFilter, TcpFilterContext, FilterAction, FilterError,
};

pub struct ConnectionLogger;

#[async_trait]
impl TcpFilter for ConnectionLogger {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str { "connection_logger" }

    async fn on_connect(
        &self, ctx: &mut TcpFilterContext<'_>,
    ) -> Result<FilterAction, FilterError> {
        tracing::info!(
            remote = ctx.remote_addr,
            "new connection"
        );
        Ok(FilterAction::Continue)
    }

    async fn on_disconnect(
        &self, ctx: &mut TcpFilterContext<'_>,
    ) -> Result<(), FilterError> {
        tracing::info!(
            remote = ctx.remote_addr,
            "connection closed"
        );
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Registration

The `register_filters!` macro uses `http "name" => factory`
syntax. TCP filters use `tcp "name" => factory`.

```rust
use my_filters::ApiKeyFilter;
use praxis_filter::register_filters;

register_filters! {
    http "api_key" => ApiKeyFilter::from_config,
}
```

The macro generates a `custom_registry()` function that
returns a `FilterRegistry` with both built-in and custom
filters. Use it with the test utilities
(`start_proxy_with_registry`) or build your own server
bootstrap from the workspace crates (`praxis-core`,
`praxis-filter`, `praxis-protocol`).

### YAML Config

```yaml
filter_chains:
  - name: main
    filters:
      - filter: api_key
        keys: ["secret-key-1", "secret-key-2"]  # use env/secrets in production
      - filter: router
        routes:
          - path_prefix: "/"
            cluster: backend
```

The YAML block under `filter: api_key` is passed as-is to
`from_config`. Conditions work with custom filters with no
extra code.

For detailed configuration of individual built-in filters,
see [configuration.md](configuration.md). For best
practices when writing custom filters, see
[extensions.md](extensions.md).
